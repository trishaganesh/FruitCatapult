# FruitCatapult
The purpose of this program is to choose a fruit and understand how we can calculate the distance of one throw for the catapult by determining velocity values, angles, and calculating the distance.


The purpose of this program is to choose a fruit we will use for a contest and then understand how we can calculate the distance 
for one throw of the catapult by converting values and using various math methods to round and calculate values.

Area for improvement: 
Initially, I struggled to understand how 2D arrays work and how I could print them properly. 
I struggled to understand how I could use a separate method to print values in the 2D array while avoiding confusion. 

What I liked: 
I enjoyed learning a new concept: 2D arrays as the previous program involved 1D arrays. 
These concepts aren't too difficult to understand with tons of practice.
